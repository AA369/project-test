Only thing missing are wireframes. My Balsamiq account expired and I hadn't done the mobile design
wireframes so I am going to start over and do them all again in Pencil over the weekend. Other than that, I'm ready to go.
I've gone through the checklist. A few outstanding queries below for tomorrow:
- Do I need a 404 page?
- is responsiveness working ok?
- is readme formatted correctly? Text highlighted in pink?
- is more commenting in html sections needed?
- I'm happy with media queries except for contact page (side nav and submit button).
- can the ID be replaced with CLASS so that modal code can be re-used instead of having to write it out each time. I had a go at doing this but wasn't successful.
-  Can we have a look at this requirement - Images always maintain their original aspect ratio when the screen is resized (crop donâ€™t stretch).
