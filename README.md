First Milestone Project: CodeYoga website

Author: Amanda Afifi

This is a static and front-end only website for a yoga studio business. It provides information on class styles, 
class scheduling and pricing. It allows clients to book a class and to contact the teacher.

The website can be accessed from this project [here](https://aa369.github.io/codeyoga-website/)

UX

Details of the UX process can be found at this [link](https://github.com/AA369/codeyoga-website/tree/master/design%20documentation).

Wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile pages can be found at this [link](https://github.com/AA369/codeyoga-website/blob/master/design%20documentation/wireframes.pdf).

The following changes were made to the final project after the wire-frames were created:

- The Booking/Pricing page became a pricing page using a more complicated grid structure.
- Images were used for desktop and tablet size on the schedule page.

- User hears about a great new yoga teacher in the area and comes to the website looking for more details. 
- User lands on home page and instantly sees the best promotional deal available for classes, with a handy link to the booking page. 
- User can  be taken quickly from the home page to the booking page to get started.
- User navigates to the about page to find out more about the teacher and her qualifications and background.
- While on the about page, the user can watch some short videos to get an idea of what style of classes are offered by the teacher, and can better decide whether they would be interested in booking a class.
